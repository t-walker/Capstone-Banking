# Varda Development Guide

## Getting Started 

It's recommended to use a Virtual Machine (VM) to run the application. The project uses Docker which allows for some flexibility however running Docker in its own VM might be the best.

## Installing Docker & Docker Compose

`sudo apt install docker.io`

`sudo apt install docker-compose`
