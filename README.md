# Varda Development Guide

## Getting Started 

It's recommended to use a Virtual Machine (VM) to run the application. The project uses Docker which allows for some flexibility however running Docker in its own VM might be the best.

## Installing Docker & Docker Compose

`sudo apt install docker.io`

`sudo apt install docker-compose`

## Running the application

To start the Docker containers, simply run the command below:

`sudo docker-compose up` 

You will be able to view the root of the application at 127.0.0.1
